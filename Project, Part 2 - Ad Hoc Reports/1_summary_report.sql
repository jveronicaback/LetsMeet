-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?
/* LetsMeet Membership growth analysis:
- Membership growth has been steadily increasing over the years, with significant jumps observed from 2015 to 2017.
- Chicago, New york, and San Francisco has all experienced substantial growth in memberrship annually, contributing to the overall upward trend.
- While overall membership growth remained strong in 2017, there are signs of a plateau compared to previous years.
- Monthly growth in 2017 appears to fluctuate, with a noticeable decline in growth towards the end of the year.
- Anomaly in December 2017, where there's an uncharacteristically low number of members (240) and an extrememly low count in December (13), which could be a data anomaly or indicative of
a seasonal trend.
# Potential reasons for membership growth plateau:
- Market saturation: In mature markets like Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, the pool of potential new members may be reaching saturation levels
- Increaded competition: The rise of competing platforms and changing user preferences could be diverting potential members away from LetsMeet.
- Seasonal Factors: Fluctuation in membership growth towards the end of the year may be influenced by seasonal factors such as holidays and year-end festivites.
# Recommendations for further analysis:
- Investigate the data anomalies in December 2017 to determine if they are due to data integrity issues or actual trends.
- Explore user demographics and preferences to understand shifts in membership behaviour and preferences.
- Conduct market research to assess the competetive landscape and indentity areas for differentiation and growth strategies.*/
